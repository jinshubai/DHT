Dht-bootstrap is an implementation of a bootstrap node for the BitTorrent
(mainline) DHT.  Rather than maintaining a Kademlia routing table, it
performs a partly random, partly breadth-first walk of the DHT, and
maintains a window of the last 255 reachable nodes that it encounters.  It
replies to find_nodes and get_peers requests with a random subset of the
reachable window.

Thanks to Greg Hazel for the initial idea.
